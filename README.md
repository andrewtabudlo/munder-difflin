Creation of a one page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Mockup located at https://wireframe.cc/Ua14T0

inspired by these websites:
https://www.and.co/digital-nomad-book
https://www.dundermifflin.us/

I wanted to keep this simple and straight to the point.
Made four sections to put content in.
Then put content inside those sections.
Then styled after I had all the elements I needed.
Used fade in and out transitions from last class workshop.
Change background-color after email submit.
Added audio functionality :)
Click link to start audio, click again to stop.
